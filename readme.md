> ***Note:*** _You can help each other, but everyone must submit their own code_

## Exercise

You are going to practice your whiteboarding skills by completing some problems from CodingBat. Please write these out on a whiteboard or on paper BEFORE typing any code on your computer. Consider talking out loud while you think through the problem, as if you were with an interviewer. It will feel silly, but it's great practice!

If you draw a blank looking at a problem, here are some questions to ask yourself:
- What is the method signature? (what is the return type, what are the parameters - CodingBat provides this for you, but interviewers won't)
- What control flow statement(s) do you need? (loop, if/else, etc)
- Do you need any local variables to temporarily hold any data?
- Are there any "edge cases" or invalid/unexpected input to look out for?

#### Requirements

- Complete these problems from CodingBat, first on whiteboard or paper, then you can check them on the website:
  - http://codingbat.com/prob/p165312
  - http://codingbat.com/prob/p159531
  - http://codingbat.com/prob/p185139
- Fork & clone this repo, then type or paste your code into a .java file (it can be in an IntelliJ project, or just a single .java file all by itself, either way is fine)
- Finally, push your code and submit a pull request; put your name in the title of the pull request

**Bonus Problems**
